<h1>Simplify Infrastructure as Code with Terraform</h1>
<p>Managing infrastructure can be complex. Terraform is a tool that makes infrastructure as code simple and efficient. In this post, we'll explore how Terraform can help what are terraform scripts streamline infrastructure provisioning and management.</p>
<h2>What is Terraform?</h2>
<p>Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code tool created by HashiCorp. It allows you to define your infrastructure in configuration files that can be versioned and treated like code. Terraform supports popular service providers like AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, and more.</p>
<p>Some key features of Terraform include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Infrastructure as Code</strong> - Infrastructure is defined and provisioned through code, enabling consistency and reproducibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Execution Plans</strong> - Terraform creates an execution plan before applying changes, allowing you to preview infrastructure changes before deploying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resource Graph</strong> - Terraform builds a resource dependency graph to provision resources in the right order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Change Automation</strong> - Complex infrastructure changes can be applied automatically with minimal human interaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-Provider Support</strong> - Terraform works across public and private cloud infrastructures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Terraform in Action</h2>
<p>Let's look at an example Terraform configuration:</p>
<p>```</p>
<h1>Configure AWS provider</h1>
<p>provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}</p>
<h1>Create VPC</h1>
<p>resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"</p>
<p>tags = {
    Name = "my-vpc"
  }
}</p>
<h1>Create subnet</h1>
<p>resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"</p>
<p>tags = {
    Name = "my-subnet"
  }
}
```</p>
<p>This config uses the AWS provider to create a VPC and subnet. The infrastructure is defined in a declarative language. To deploy, simply run <code>terraform apply</code>. Terraform will create an execution plan and make the changes.</p>
<p>Terraform manages the state of infrastructure. On subsequent applies, Terraform only changes what is needed. Resources can also be destroyed with <code>terraform destroy</code>.</p>
<h2>When to Use Terraform</h2>
<p>Terraform is great for scenarios like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up cloud infrastructure from scratch</li>
<li>Managing infrastructure changes and provisioning</li>
<li>Multi-cloud deployments (e.g. AWS and on-prem)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a versatile tool that gives you consistent workflows for infrastructure across providers.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Terraform makes infrastructure as code scalable, reusable, and collaborative. Defining infrastructure declaratively helps eliminate drift and human error. Automation and execution plans enable safe infrastructure changes. For what are terraform scripts and anyone managing infrastructure, Terraform is an essential tool for simplifying provisioning and management.</p>

<h1>The Ultimate Beginner's Guide to Terraform Outputs</h1>
<p>Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code tool that allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure in a safe, repeatable way. Outputs are a key concept in Terraform that enable you to extract data from your infrastructure and make it available for use elsewhere. In this post, we'll cover the basics of working with outputs in Terraform.</p>
<h2>What are Terraform Outputs?</h2>
<p>Terraform outputs allow you to extract data from resources created by Terraform and make that data available to other parts of your software stack. For example, you may want to output the public IP address of a server that was created so that it can be referenced later. </p>
<p>Outputs are defined in the outputs.tf file and consist of a name, value, and optional description:</p>
<p><code>output "server_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip 
  description = "The public IP address of the web server" 
}</code></p>
<p>The value field specifies an expression that will be evaluated and returned when applying the Terraform configuration. This allows you to reference attributes of resources that were created by Terraform.</p>
<h2>Key Use Cases for Outputs</h2>
<p>Some common use cases for outputs include:</p>
<h3>Passing data between Terraform configurations</h3>
<p>You can output data from one Terraform configuration and reference it as an input variable in another configuration. This allows you to share state between different parts of your infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Bootstrapping</h3>
<p>Use outputs to pass data to external bootstrapping scripts. For example, you may want to output configuration data from Terraform and use it to configure a load balancer.</p>
<h3>Post-provision validation</h3>
<p>Extract output data to validate that your infrastructure is configured correctly. For example, retrieve the public IP of a server and make a request to validate it returns the expected response.</p>
<h3>Connection details</h3>
<p>Output values like connection strings, URLs, and credentials so they can be consumed by other systems.</p>
<h2>Example Outputs</h2>
<p>Here are some example outputs for common infrastructure:</p>
<p>```</p>
<h1>Public IP address of a compute instance</h1>
<p>output "server_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}</p>
<h1>DNS of a load balancer</h1>
<p>output "lb_dns" {
  value = aws_lb.example.dns_name 
}</p>
<h1>Connection string for a database</h1>
<p>output "db_connection_string" {
  value = "postgres://${aws_db_instance.example.username}:${aws_db_instance.example.password}@${aws_db_instance.example.endpoint}/${aws_db_instance.example.db_name}"
}
```</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Outputs are a key feature of Terraform that enable you to export data from your Terraform state for use in other parts of your infrastructure. Common uses for outputs include passing data between Terraform configs, bootstrapping external tools, validating your stack, and exporting connection details. Defining outputs is simple - just specify a name, value expression, and optional description. Use outputs to get the most out of Terraform!</p>

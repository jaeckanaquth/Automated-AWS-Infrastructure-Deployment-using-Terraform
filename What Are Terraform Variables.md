<h1>Discover the Power of Terraform Variables with what are terraform variables</h1>
<p>Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that allows you to define, provision and manage infrastructure in a safe, consistent manner. One of its most useful features is variables - they make your Terraform configurations reusable and customizable. In this post, we'll explore how variables can supercharge your Terraform workflows.</p>
<h2>What Are Terraform Variables?</h2>
<p>Variables allow you to parameterize your Terraform code. Instead of hardcoding values like resource names, counts, etc., you assign them to variables that can be reused and customized without modifying the core code. </p>
<p>For example, you can define a variable called <code>instance_count</code> and use it to determine how many AWS EC2 instances get spun up:</p>
<p>```
variable "instance_count" {
  default = 1
}</p>
<p>resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  count = var.instance_count 
  # ...
}
```</p>
<p>This allows you to change the number of instances by simply tweaking the <code>instance_count</code> variable value. No need to touch the Terraform code itself.</p>
<h2>Why Use Variables?</h2>
<p>There are two main reasons to use variables in Terraform:</p>
<p><strong>Customization:</strong> Variables make your Terraform code reusable across different environments. Just change the variable values rather than rewriting everything.</p>
<p><strong>Secret management:</strong> Sensitive data like passwords and API keys can be defined as variables. Set their values via environment variables for extra security. </p>
<p>Variables allow you to build dynamic, flexible infrastructure without compromising on organization or security.</p>
<h2>Variable Syntax</h2>
<p>Here is the basic syntax for defining variables in Terraform:</p>
<p><code>variable "name" {
  type = string
  default = "value"
}</code></p>
<p>The <code>name</code> is the variable identifier you'll reference throughout the code. <code>type</code> constrains the variable to a particular data type like string, number, bool, etc. <code>default</code> assigns a default value if one isn't specified.</p>
<p>You reference variables using Terraform's interpolation syntax: <code>var.name</code></p>
<h2>Common Practices with Variables</h2>
<p>Here are some best practices when working with Terraform variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store sensitive data and passwords in variables. Never hardcode them.</li>
<li>Group associated variables together in their own files (e.g. <code>vpc.tfvars</code>)</li>
<li>Prefix variable names (e.g. <code>app_instance_count</code>) for better organization</li>
<li>Set descriptions for each variable to document their purpose</li>
<li>Use <code>tfvars</code> files to assign variable values for different environments</li>
<li>Validate variable types to prevent issues and bugs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Putting Variables to Work</h2>
<p>Now that you understand Terraform variables, go give them a try! Start parameterizing your Terraform configs to make your infrastructure more flexible and reusable. </p>
